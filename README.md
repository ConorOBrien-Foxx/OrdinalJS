A beautiful wrapper for all of your ordinal property needs!

**OrdinalJS** is your new best friend. No longer will you need those unclear, nasty, confusing ol' brackets + index pairs! Now, you can use a more verbose and clear way to access that element of your array. Want to access the first element? Instead of using `array[0]`, you now are able to use `array.first`! It even can be written!

Need to access the `33`rd element? Not a problem! Merely use `array.thirty_third`! It's just that simple!! You can even access the last element of a list, with `array.last`!

What are you waiting for? Include the following line in each of your JavaScript and HTML projects today!
